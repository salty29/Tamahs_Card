                Dear Tamah,<br>
                What can I say.  I've been terrible at getting you cards all year and there really is no excuse.  I do have a stack of physical cards that need to be written in and I'll still do that but I want you to know how much I love you even though I haven't written it down much this year.<br><br>

                I just want you to know that I love you more than anything and I'm so glad that we got married young and were able to experience so many firsts together.  We've been blessed to be by each others side through all the highs and lows that life has thrown our way.<br><br>

                I pray that the years ahead will be full of challenges so that we can continue to grow and maybe help other people from the things that we learn.<br><br>

                I love the Godly woman you are babe and you are the most beautiful girl in the world to me!  Most of all I love your kindness and the care that you show me and the kids as well as all our friends.<br><br>

                You are truly loved and I look forward to making so many more memories with you as the years go by and my hair goes grayer.<br><br>

                Love always, your adoring husband.<br>
                Ash xxxxoooo
